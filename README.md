# AndroidStudioTrivialDrive

Learning In-App Billing at the Google Play Store ain't simple.

One of the hurdles is having to massage the old Eclipse sample project into AndroidStudio.

This repo contains the TrivialDrive project happily imported into AndroidStudio, equipped with all the needed Gradle jazz and upgraded to more recent Android versions.

This branch `working-example` contains the evolution of the Android Studio project up to a completely working app, with purchaseable items.

Clone and enjoy!
